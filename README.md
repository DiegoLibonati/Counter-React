## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Join to the correct path of the clone
3. Execute: `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Execute: `yarn start` or `npm start` and enjoy!

## Description

I made a web application that serves as a counter, basically we have 3 buttons. An `increase` button that adds one to our variable or state, `decrease` that subtracts one to our variable or state and `reset` that resets our variable or state to 0. If the number is positive it will be green, if it is 0 it will be white and if it is negative it will be red.

## Technologies used

1. React JS
2. Typescript
3. CSS3
